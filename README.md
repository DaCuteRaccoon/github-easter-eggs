# Easter Eggs Within GitHub
<br/>

## <b>Pi</b><br/>
An ASCII representation of PI on github at
https://github.com/π,
the number pi at
https://github.com/π.json,
and an image of a pie at
https://github.com/π.jpeg<br/>

## <b>Octocat</b><br/>
There is an ASCII octocat at https://api.github.com/octocat...<br/>
But be careful, some [ASCII code is executable](https://github.com/xyzzy/smile), like this one here, so use curl at your own risk...<br/>
`curl https://api.github.com/octocat`

## <b>Spicy User Profile</b><br/>
This is not exactly a *secret* secret, but id you know that you can create a markdown file for your own Github Page?<br/>
First, [create a new repository](https://github.com/new), the name of the repository being your username. For example, I would name the repository DaCuteRaccoon, because my username is DaCuteRaccoon. Then, just edit your markdown file, and it should display on your profile, without even using GitHub pages! [Click here for an example of mine](https://github.com/DaCuteRaccoon/DaCuteRaccoon).

## <b>Skyline</b><br/>
[GitHub Skyline](https://skyline.github.com/) is a tool to view your contributions on GitHub. But this isn't the easter egg part. Enter the [Konami Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code), `↑` `↑` `↓` `↓` `←` `→` `←` `→` `B` `A`, and you will get a cool surprise!<br/>
If you don't have any GitHub contributions, you can test it on [my GitHub Skyline](https://skyline.github.com/DaCuteRaccoon/2020).

## <b>Video</b><br/>
If you go to https://github.co/video, a special video will be waiting for you!<br/>
